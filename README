This addon plays a loud "horn" sound when you receive an invitation to the dungeon through the LFG system,

The sound is played even when game client is minimized with the sound and/or music turned off. Or even in "background mode"
From now on you will not miss your turn in the dungenon or LFR after waiting for 30 min =)
